# Homebrew formula for bladerunner — SOURCE OF TRUTH.
#
# Source-controlled so formula changes flow through code review. The release
# workflow (.github/workflows/release-please.yml) fills the version and the
# darwin/arm64 sha256 from the just-published release, then syncs a rendered
# copy into stuffbucket/homebrew-tap (Formula/bladerunner.rb). The two values
# are the only per-release edits, so a bump is one workflow run.

    # Re-apply the Virtualization.framework entitlement via an ad-hoc signature

    # is belt-and-suspenders in case extraction/relocation invalidated it.

    <<~EOS
      bladerunner requires Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) and macOS 13+.

      `br` has been ad-hoc codesigned with Virtualization.framework entitlements.
      If you need to re-sign manually:
        codesign --entitlements #{prefix}/vz.entitlements -s - #{bin}/br
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match version.to_s, shell_output("#{bin}/br --version")
  end
end
